- 👋 Hi, I’m @batamig
- 👀 I’m interested in making software easier and simpler to use so that customers can do more.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about security products across both Microsoft 365 and Azure, and about managing life and work in a post-covid world.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Microsoft docs - contribute by sending a git issue or opening a PR on my content!
